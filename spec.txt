Next Page Animation

When the next button is clicked, reset the duaId in the sessionStorage by adding 1 to the duaId. And update the page with json data with the id in the dua.json.
Can I create a python server to run a specific local website?

Give some padding to sides of the text
stop the player when next/previous btn is clicked

# 

create a python script which when run opens a server on localhost in the context of the folder that it is in. So when I navigate to localhost:3456/hi.html it opens the website

I want set the same duaId of each card in to data-set variable so that when the card is clicked, it sets the duaID in session storage and navigate to duas.html with the right dua on card click.
      fetch("duas.json")
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((data) => {
          duas = data.map((dua) => {
            const duaData = data[duaId];
            const card = duaTemplate.content.cloneNode(true).children[0];

            const image = card.querySelector("[data-image]");
            const title = card.querySelector("[data-title]");

            title.textContent = dua.title;
            image.src = "images/" + duaId + ".jpg";

            duaId++;
            duaCardsCont.append(card);
            return {
              title: dua.title,
              element: card,
              image: "images/" + duaId + ".jpg",
            };
          });
        });



Data is fetched and placed in cards, for each card data-dua-id is set. 
Now I would want to add that for each card when clicked get the corresponding data-dua-id store and set it to sessionStorage
